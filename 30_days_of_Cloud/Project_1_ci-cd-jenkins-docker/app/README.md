# CI/CD with Jenkins and Docker

This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. It guides you through setting up Jenkins, creating a Jenkins pipeline, and integrating Docker for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Jenkins
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitacm/-30DaysDevChallenge-.git
cd 30_days_of_cloud/Project_1_ci-cd-jenkins-docker
```
````

### Step 2: Install Docker

#### For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

#### For Windows/Mac:

- Download and install Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Step 3: Install Jenkins

#### For Ubuntu:

```bash
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

#### For Windows/Mac:

- Download and install Jenkins from [Jenkins' official website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).

### Step 4: Set Up Jenkins

1. Open Jenkins in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Follow the setup instructions to unlock Jenkins:
   - Retrieve the initial admin password:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
     ```
   - Paste the password into the web interface.
3. Install suggested plugins.
4. Create your first admin user.

### Step 5: Configure Jenkins with Docker

1. Install the **Docker Pipeline** plugin in Jenkins:

   - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins`.
   - Search for "Docker Pipeline" and install it.

2. Add your user to the Docker group:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

3. Restart Jenkins:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart jenkins
   ```

### Step 6: Create a Jenkins Pipeline

1. Create a new Jenkins job:

   - Go to the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on `New Item`.
   - Enter a name for your job, select `Pipeline`, and click `OK`.

2. Configure the Pipeline:

   - Scroll down to the `Pipeline` section.
   - Select `Pipeline script` from the Definition dropdown.
   - In the Script box, enter the following Jenkins Pipeline script:
